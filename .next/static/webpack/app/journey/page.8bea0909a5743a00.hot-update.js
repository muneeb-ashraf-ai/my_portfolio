With 918 out of 1100 marks, I performed well academically. Many people encouraged me to become a doctor, but my passion for Mathematics pulled me in another direction.\\n\\nI enrolled in FSc Pre-Engineering at Government Zamindar Postgraduate College, Gujrat, scoring 819 out of 1100. While most around me leaned toward Biology, I chose Mathematics. During this period, I also discovered my talent for teaching and began teaching Mathematics at Ali Science Academy. This experience planted the seed of a lifelong passion for education.\\n\\nInitially, I planned to pursue engineering and was even selected for a university program. But financial constraints forced me to rethink, so I opted for a more affordable option: a BSc in Mathematics and Physics at Zamindar College.

I not only gained strong academic knowledge but also improved my confidence, problem-solving skills, and social experience. More importantly, I came across the field of Data Science. Fascinated, I began learning Python programming through YouTube tutorials. Soon, I was exploring Machine Learning, discovering how it connected Mathematics with technology—my two lifelong passions. Throughout my degree at GCUL, I stayed socially active. I was a member of the Chawla Mathematics Society, helping organize mathematical seminars and workshops.

While teaching gave me satisfaction, I soon realized that in Pakistan it isn't a financially rewarding profession. I could barely meet my expenses, and it was clear that supporting a family would be very difficult with teaching alone. Around this time, I had already come across the term Data Science during my MSc days, which had sparked my curiosity. That realization, combined with the financial struggles of teaching, motivated me to explore technology more seriously. I began learning Python through YouTube tutorials, taking my first steps toward a career in tech while still holding on to my passion for Mathematics and education.\\n\\nAround this time, I discovered a training program in Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning and Deep Learning) at Minhaj University, Lahore, offered by NAVTTC. This was my formal entry into programming, where I built foundations in ML and DL. Alongside, I took multiple online courses from Coursera in areas like Data Science Math Skills (Duke University), Discrete Mathematics (UC San Diego), Mathematical Thinking (Stanford), Algebra (Johns Hopkins), and more. I also worked on projects like brain tumor detection using CNN, credit card fraud detection, diabetes classification, CIFAR image classification, and building a career chatbot.

I applied for foreign scholarships, but due to my 2+2 degree structure (BSc + MSc instead of a 4-year BS), I faced repeated rejections. This was a disheartening phase, but it didn't break my resolve. Instead, I decided to take a step-by-step approach: complete an MS in Pakistan first, and then reapply abroad for a PhD.\\n\\nCurrently, I am working in a more demanding and rewarding role at Meissasoft. This is a full-fledged internship where I not only focus on coding and projects but also gain a deeper understanding of how the industry functions. I practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by building a Chess Game Engine and a Ride Sharing Simulation. I solve Data Structures and Algorithms problems on HackerRank, design SQL databases, and create a CRUD-based Student Management System using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. Unlike my short internship at InsightSol, this experience gives me real insight into the market—how companies structure projects, manage databases, build APIs, and test applications before deployment.

My journey hasn't been smooth. Financial struggles, academic interruptions, and scholarship rejections have all been part of the path. But each challenge only strengthened my resilience and reinforced my purpose. Mathematics taught me logic, teaching taught me clarity, and Artificial Intelligence gave me a vision.
